# project3
there are three projects in all, which i worked on to showcase my data analysis skills.
each project contains an introduction, and the programming codes used to analyse the dataset.
in the projects various questions were asked about the dataset and answered based on the python code results and visualizations.
interesting insights were made into the dataset.
